# Convex_Hull_Problem
The 'Convex_Hull_Problem' repository contains the 'Convex Hull Problem' project files from the class 'Algorithm' conducted by Professor Jung-Hyun Kim at the School of AI convergence studies, Handong Global University

The Convex Hull Problem is a type of problem where given a set of coordinates in an n-dimensional space, one must return a sequence of nodes that encompasses all other coordinates. In the context of a 2-dimensional space, given a set of coordinates in a 2-dimensional space, one must find a sequence of coordinates that encompasses all other coordinates. However, the no two edges must have a concave shape (i.e., in-bending). 

We solve the Convex Hull Problem using the 'two-finger method', a type of divide and conquer algorithm proposed by Professor Srinivas Devadas from MIT.
